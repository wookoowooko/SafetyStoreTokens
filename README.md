# Secure Data Storage with Android Key Store and DataStore

This project demonstrates how to securely store JWT tokens(fore example) using DataStore.
The application simulates a login process and saves the JWT token securely on the device, ensuring the data is encrypted.

## Features

- **JWT Authentication Simulation**: A basic login form where a username and password are entered.
- **Secure Token Storage**: The JWT token is saved in the device's DataStore and is encrypted.
- **Data Verification**: The stored JWT token is retrieved and displayed, allowing you to verify that the data is correctly saved and encrypted.


## How it Works

- The user inputs a username and password into the form.
- The app simulates a login by generating a fake JWT token.
- This JWT token is saved securely in DataStore.
- The token is encrypted to ensure secure storage.
- After login, the token is retrieved from DataStore and displayed to confirm that the data is correctly stored.
